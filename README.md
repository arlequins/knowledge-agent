# template-knowledge-agent

An AWS-ready, provider-neutral template for evidence-grounded chat over
Fumadocs documentation, T3 monorepos, approved live application data, and
eventually legacy codebases.

The same conversation and knowledge core serves three delivery surfaces:

- a Google-authenticated chat application with conversation history;
- an origin-allowlisted embedded chat widget; and
- an OAuth-protected remote MCP server.

The first runnable profile is intentionally local: PostgreSQL stores
conversations and indexed knowledge, while OpenAI provides chat completions and
embeddings. Real documents, source snapshots, database exports, evaluation
questions, and API keys belong in ignored local paths and are never part of the
public template.

## Design priorities

- Start with TypeScript, T3, and Fumadocs; add Java, Ruby, and C# through stable
  analyzer plugin contracts after the primary path is reliable.
- Keep model providers replaceable through clean-architecture adapters. OpenAI
  is the first hosted adapter; Amazon Bedrock is the intended AWS production
  adapter, with Anthropic and Gemini available by policy.
- Ground answers in repository locations, source excerpts, and live tool
  results. If the available evidence is insufficient, say so.
- Use PostgreSQL full-text and vector retrieval; OpenSearch is not required.
- Read changing business data through allowlisted, read-only tRPC tools rather
  than generated SQL or page scraping.
- Improve quality through replayable daily evaluations, not real-time
  fine-tuning.

## Stack

| Area | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace | pnpm catalogs, Turborepo, TypeScript, Biome |
| Web | Next.js App Router, React, Tailwind CSS |
| API | Hono and tRPC, local Node.js server, optional AWS Lambda |
| Local persistence | PostgreSQL with Drizzle migrations |
| Model boundary | Provider-neutral agent core with OpenAI, Bedrock, and Ollama adapters |
| Authentication | Local OIDC mock; Google-compatible OIDC configuration |
| Testing | Vitest, PostgreSQL integration tests, Playwright, accessibility checks |

## Local pilot

Requirements are Node.js and pnpm versions matching `package.json`, Docker, and
an OpenAI API key. Start from the checked-in examples; do not commit the local
environment file.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm agent:setup
# Add OPENAI_API_KEY to .env.localhost
pnpm db:start
pnpm db:setup
pnpm knowledge:bootstrap
pnpm knowledge:index -- --source /absolute/path/to/your/repository --workspace-id <uuid-from-ui>
pnpm knowledge:sync-official -- --workspace-id <uuid-from-ui>
pnpm dev:local
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The local identity provider accepts any non-empty
username and password. The API is available at `http://localhost:5000`, with
liveness at `/health/live`, readiness at `/health/ready`, and tRPC at
`/api/trpc`.

The public example corpus lives under `examples/knowledge`. Private material is
loaded from ignored `.local/` paths or an explicitly supplied absolute source
path. The indexer reads files; it does not run repository lifecycle scripts.
The official documentation catalog in `config/official-knowledge-sources.json`
contains only public canonical URLs and host allowlists; downloaded text and
embeddings stay in the local database.

## Useful commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev:local` | Start the local database, identity provider, API, and web app. |
| `pnpm agent:setup` | Create `.env.localhost` without overwriting existing values. |
| `pnpm knowledge:index` | Index an approved document or source tree. |
| `pnpm knowledge:bootstrap` | Create the repeatable local test workspace. |
| `pnpm knowledge:sync-official` | Index allowlisted official stack documentation. |
| `pnpm check` | Run Biome formatting and lint checks. |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Typecheck every workspace. |
| `pnpm test` | Run unit and contract tests. |
| `pnpm test:integration` | Test PostgreSQL-backed repositories. |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Run the browser flow. |

roadmap](docs/roadmap.md), and [the documentation index](docs/README.md).
Deployment-specific controls are documented in
[deployment security](docs/deployment-security.md). AWS deployments use GitHub
Actions with OIDC; no long-lived AWS credential belongs in this repository.
