# Roadmap

## Phase 0: repository and contracts

- Repository governance, automated SemVer releases, and architecture records.
- Shared schemas for users, conversations, citations, knowledge units, analyzer
  plugins, model providers, live tools, usage, and evaluations.
- Small Fumadocs and T3 fixtures with initial gold questions.

## Phase 1: T3 vertical slice

- Google-authenticated standalone chat and conversation history.
- Fumadocs and TypeScript/T3 ingestion with commit, file, symbol, and line
  provenance.
- Allowlisted synchronization of official React, Next.js, tRPC, Drizzle, Zod,
  Fumadocs, SST, Turborepo, pnpm, and Hono documentation.
- Retrieval through PostgreSQL keyword and embedding search, with optional S3
  Vectors for the AWS profile.
- Portable Ollama local-pilot, optional MLX/OpenAI profiles, and a Bedrock
  production adapter with grounded streaming
  answers.

## Phase 2: embedded chat and MCP

- Origin-allowlisted iframe widget with popup authentication.
- [x] Remote MCP endpoint with scoped OAuth authorization (opt-in; live tools
  enforce workspace membership, bounded output, and audit logging).
- Shared conversation history across web, widget, and MCP channels.

## Phase 3: live business data

- Explicit read-only tRPC capability registry.
- Typed tool execution with user/tenant authorization, bounded results, audit
  records, and live-data citations.
- Initial announcement and recently sold vehicle query fixtures.

## Phase 4: evaluation and scale

- Daily replay, verified gold cases, provider routing, cost budgets, repetition
  checks, and guarded configuration promotion.
- Optional reviewed LoRA candidates with disjoint train/validation/test data,
  evidence-backed promotion, explicit model reload, and tested rollback.
- Bedrock-on-demand as the initial intermittent AWS traffic profile; qualify an
  EC2/SageMaker open-model runtime only when exact weights or sustained
  utilization justify GPU operations.
- Incremental indexing and operational limits for larger monorepos.

## Phase 5: legacy analyzers

- Add one language at a time, selected from real demand.
- Begin with project detection and symbol/route/data-model extraction; avoid a
  universal parser framework until the T3 contract has proved stable.
- Candidates are Java/Spring, Ruby/Rails, and C#/ASP.NET.
